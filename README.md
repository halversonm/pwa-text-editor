# Text Editor (PWA)

## Description
This text editor application serves as an example of a progressive web app (PWA). It features numerous data persistence techniques and will function when offline. By building this app I was able to practice my skills in building progressive web apps and implenting technologies such as WebPack, Workbox, service workers, and more. 

## Installation 
To install the app on your local machine simply click the install button after opening the application. 

## Usage
